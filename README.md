Hello!

You can checkout the visual demonstration here: https://incomparable-faloodeh-5da5e7.netlify.app;

This is the project where I tested my form application/validation developing skills particularly. I got this opportunity to express and demonstrate my skillset in this way from the company called Redberry as you might have guessed from the repository title. There is no any peculiar web technologies I've used in this app, but it trully gave me the chance to advance my ability to develop application with decent approach and it really strengthened my skills, especially conditional data fetching, memoizing it and etc.

Used technologies:
~React (Functional);
~Styled-components with SCSS syntax;
~REST API;
~State management with useReducer() hook;

At the moment I'm planning to migrate this project to Redux/Redux-Saga just to practice for a bit.
